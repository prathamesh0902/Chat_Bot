## Running Flask-Dependent Projects Locally

For Flask-based projects that require Python backend logic, you can’t directly host them on GitHub Pages. Instead, you need to run these projects locally on your machine.

### Steps to Run Locally:

1. **Install Flask**: Ensure you have Flask installed. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal in the local directory:

    ```bash
    pip install flask
    ```

2. **Run the Python Application**: Navigate to the directory containing your Python app and start the app with:

    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

3. **Access the Application**: Once the server is running, you can access your Flask app by opening your web browser and navigating to:

    ```
    http://localhost:5000
    ```

Now, your Flask application should be running locally, and you can interact with it via the browser.
